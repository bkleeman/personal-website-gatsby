# My Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website. This application is served over https @ https://benjaminkleeman.surge.sh/ and is available as a Progressive Web App for mobile and desktop environments. My exploration into Gatsby has helped me learn about JavaScript frameworks, React and GraphQL fundamentals, serving dynamic content as a static site, and a bit about combining client-side & server-side rendering to maximize efficiency.

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for components
